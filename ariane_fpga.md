# Ariane on FPGAs

This document shows my progress trying to map ariane to a Diligent Zybo-Z7 FPGA (Xilinx ZYNQ 7020).

## Installing the requirements

After at least one (!) day of installing Vivado, RISCV-Tools and other tools I finally managed to simulate ariane and had a running instance of Vivado. To install the RISCV-Tools and run ariane you can follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/Moschn/2a8a5835cd842e8a562b08f14aecffda)
